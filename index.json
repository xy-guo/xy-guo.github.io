However, its performance is still inferior compared with LiDAR-based detection algorithms. To detect and localize accurate 3D bounding boxes, LiDAR-based detectors encode high-level representations from LiDAR point clouds, such as accurate object boundaries and surface normal directions. In contrast, high-level features learned by stereo-based detectors are easily affected by the erroneous depth estimation due to the limitation of stereo matching. To solve the problem, we propose LIGA-Stereo (LiDAR Geometry Aware Stereo Detector) to learn stereo-based 3D detectors under the guidance of high-level geometry-aware representations of LiDAR-based detection models. In addition, we found existing voxel-based stereo detectors failed to learn semantic features effectively from indirect 3D supervisions. We attach an auxiliary 2D detection head to provide direct 2D semantic supervisions. Experiment results show that the above two strategies improved the geometric and semantic representation capabilities. Compared with the state-of-the-art stereo detector, our method has improved the 3D detection performance of cars, pedestrians, cyclists by 10.44%, 5.69%, 5.97% mAP respectively on the official KITTI benchmark. The gap between stereo-based and LiDAR-based 3D detectors is further narrowed.\n Results         Visualization  KITTI Benchmark If you want to cite our work, please use:\n@InProceedings{Guo_2021_ICCV, author = {Guo, Xiaoyang and Shi, Shaoshuai and Wang, Xiaogang and Li, Hongsheng}, title = {LIGA-Stereo: Learning LiDAR Geometry Aware Representations for Stereo-based 3D Detector}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)}, month = {October}, year = {2021} }  ","date":1625097600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625097600,"objectID":"6f9f8125a8cd9d7e66520ad2d80254ad","permalink":"https://xy-guo.github.io/liga/","publishdate":"2021-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/liga/","section":"","summary":"LIGA-Stereo: Learning LiDAR Geometry Aware Representations for Stereo-based 3D Detector","tags":null,"title":"LIGA-Stereo: Learning LiDAR Geometry Aware Representations for Stereo-based 3D Detector","type":"page"},{"authors":["Xiaoyang Guo","Mingyang Liang","Hongsheng Li","Xiaogang Wang","You Song"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Previous works built cost volumes with cross-correlation or concatenation of left and right features across all disparity levels, and then a 2D or 3D convolutional neural network is utilized to regress the disparity maps. In this paper, we propose to construct the cost volume by group-wise correlation. The left features and the right features are divided into groups along the channel dimension, and correlation maps are computed among each group to obtain multiple matching cost proposals, which are then packed into a cost volume. Group-wise correlation provides efficient representations for measuring feature similarities and will not lose too much information like full correlation. It also preserves better performance when reducing parameters compared with previous methods. The 3D stacked hourglass network proposed in previous works is improved to boost the performance and decrease the inference computational cost. Experiment results show that our method outperforms previous methods on Scene Flow, KITTI 2012, and KITTI 2015 datasets.","tags":[],"title":"Group-wise Correlation Stereo Network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaoyang Guo","Hongsheng Li","Shuai Yi","Jimmy Ren","Xiaogang Wang"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

The routing scheme ensures only certain capsules which resemble lower counterparts in the higher layer should be activated. However, the computational complexity becomes a bottleneck for scaling up to larger networks, as lower capsules need to correspond to each and every higher capsule. To resolve this limitation, we approximate the routing process with two branches: a master branch which collects primary information from its direct contact in the lower layer and an aide branch that replenishes master based on pattern variants encoded in other lower capsules. Compared with previous iterative and unsupervised routing scheme, these two branches are communicated in a fast, supervised and one-time pass fashion. The complexity and runtime of the model are therefore decreased by a large margin. Motivated by the routing to make higher capsule have agreement with lower capsule, we extend the mechanism as a compensation for the rapid loss of information in nearby layers. We devise a feedback agreement unit to send back higher capsules as feedback. It could be regarded as an additional regularization to the network. The feedback agreement is achieved by comparing the optimal transport divergence between two distributions (lower and higher capsules). Such an add-on witnesses a unanimous gain in both capsule and vanilla networks. Our proposed EncapNet performs favorably better against previous state-of-the-arts on CIFAR10/100, SVHN and a subset of ImageNet.","tags":[],"title":"Neural Network Encapsulation","type":"publication"}]
